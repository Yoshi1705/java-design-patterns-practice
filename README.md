This repository contains clean, practical implementations of design patterns in Java, created to strengthen Low Level Design (LLD) understanding and interview readiness.

The focus is on:

Clear intent of each pattern

Realistic use cases

Clean object-oriented design

SOLID principles

Thread-safety where applicable

🧠 Why this Repository?

Design patterns are best learned by implementing, not memorizing.

This repo is built to:

Understand when and why a pattern is used

See how patterns solve real design problems

Gain confidence for LLD interviews

Build reusable mental models for system design

📦 Patterns Covered
✅ Creational Patterns

Simple Factory – Centralized object creation

Factory Method – Delegating object creation to subclasses

Abstract Factory – Creating families of related objects

Builder – Step-by-step construction of complex objects

Prototype – Cloning objects efficiently

Singleton – Single instance management

Object Pool – Reusing expensive objects (thread-safe)

🚧 Structural Patterns (In Progress / Planned)

Adapter

Decorator

Facade

Composite

Proxy

Bridge

Flyweight

🚀 Behavioral Patterns (Planned)

Strategy

Observer

Command

Template Method

State

Chain of Responsibility

🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

Java (Core + OOP)

Interfaces & Abstract Classes

SOLID Principles

Java Concurrency (ExecutorService, BlockingQueue)

Functional Interfaces & Lambdas

Thread-safe designs

Clean code practices

🧪 How to Run

Each pattern is implemented in its own package with:

Core interfaces

Concrete implementations

Client / demo class

You can run any pattern by executing its Client or Main class.
