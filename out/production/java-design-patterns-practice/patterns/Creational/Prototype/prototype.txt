Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern used when object creation is expensive or complex, and we want to create new objects by copying an existing object instead of creating one from scratch.

Instead of using new, we:

Create a prototype object

Clone it

Modify the clone as needed

Key idea:

Create new objects by copying existing ones.
