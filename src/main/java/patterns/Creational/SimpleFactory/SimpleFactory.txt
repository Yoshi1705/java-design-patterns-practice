Simple Factory is a creational design approach where a single class is responsible for creating objects based on input parameters.

It encapsulates object creation logic in one place.

The client does not use new directly.

Object type is decided using conditions (if–else / switch).

It is not an official GoF design pattern, just a common coding practice.

Purpose:
To reduce coupling by centralizing object creation and hiding concrete class details from the client.
