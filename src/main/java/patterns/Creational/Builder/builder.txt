=>We use the Builder Design Pattern when the process of creating an object becomes complex or “scary,” especially when a constructor requires too many fields and becomes hard to manage.
=>For example, consider building a house. A basic house needs components like walls, door, roof, and windows.
Later, we may want to extend it by adding optional features like a swimming pool or a garden.
=>If we try to handle all these required and optional components using one large constructor, the code becomes messy and difficult to understand.
There are two general approaches:
Create a parent interface with basic building steps, and have subclasses provide implementations for optional features.
Create a class with all fields (mandatory + optional), which makes the constructor difficult to use and maintain.
To solve this problem cleanly, we use the Builder Pattern.
It separates the object construction logic from the client code, so the client does not need to worry about how the object is created.
The pattern introduces separate Builder classes that take care of assembling the object step-by-step.
We then use another class called the Director (not decorator) to define the sequence of steps needed to build the final product.
This ensures object creation is:
clean
flexible
easy to extend
readable for the client
