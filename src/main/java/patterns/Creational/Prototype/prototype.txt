Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern used when object creation is expensive or complex, and we want to create new objects by copying an existing object instead of creating one from scratch.

Instead of using new, we:

Create a prototype object

Clone it

Modify the clone as needed

Key idea:

Create new objects by copying existing ones.

✔ Prototype = object that knows how to clone itself
✔ Registry = stores different prototype objects
✔ Registry returns clone, not original
✔ Clone creates a new object with copied state
If an object has private state, it must own its cloning logic.

That’s why each object creates a clone of itself.
ection must be cloneable (very important)
If a field is mutable, you must create a new instance of it while cloning.

Final Mental Checklist for Prototype

When writing clone() always ask:

❓ Is this field mutable?

❓ If yes → create a new object

❓ Does this object itself need cloning?

If you follow this, you’ll never mess up Prototype again.
